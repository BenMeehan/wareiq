## Edge Cases and Handling
### Email Sending Failure on Our Side:
Handling: Implement a retry mechanism to resend emails. Commit the offset only if the email is successfully sent.

### Email Sending Failure on Provider's Side:
Handling: Retry sending emails, and if retries are exhausted, move the message to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual inspection.

### Fallback Provider:
Handling: Configure multiple email service providers with a fallback mechanism. Switch to an alternative provider if the primary provider fails.

### User Opt-Out:
Handling: Provide an option for users to opt-out of email notifications. Respect user preferences.

### Invalid User Email:
Handling: Validate user email addresses before pushing to kafka.

### Event Payload Size: (not a huge issue if event is predefined)
Handling: Validate the size of the event payload to prevent excessively large messages from overwhelming the system.

### Email Throttling:
Handling: Implement email throttling to avoid being flagged as spam by email service providers.
